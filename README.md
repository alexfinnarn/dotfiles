# Lotza Dotz

My dotfiles in all their wonderful glory...or are they? Hmmm? You got this!!!

## I am not TOO Fancy

So, here's what I need to do to setup a new 'puter for the coding.

### SSH Keys

Oh yeah, start here. Cause GH wants one to clone down this repo. As good as any: https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

I put shit in `~/Sites` at this point. But dotfiles aren't "sites" Alex? Go shut up and drink a beer...while I clone down this repo into that directory.

### Homebrew

Beer you say? Well this ain't as fun, but we gotta use it. I mean, it is fun. Yay! https://brew.sh/

### PhpStorm

The included JAR file in this repo is enough to get that damn annoying termnial bar to behave. I'll tell you that much so far...

### Zsh

Weren't it great.
